    "[R](http://www.r-project.org)  is an open-source programming language consisting of a collection of free software programs (in the [GNU](http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.es.html) sense) designed for statistical data analysis. It allows performing everything from simple descriptive analyses (such as frequency tables, mean calculation, correlations, etc.) to more complex procedures (such as hypothesis testing, analysis of variance, principal component analysis, etc.). Only a few of the analytical possibilities offered by R will be covered in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "R enables three essential functions: (1) reading data, (2) specifying the type of analysis to be performed on that data, and (3) displaying the results obtained after the analyses. Selecting an appropriate methodology for a given study, as well as interpreting the results, is the responsibility of the researcher or software user. For this reason, it is necessary for the user to understand the theoretical foundation of the various statistical methods available to ensure that both the application of the analysis and the interpretation of the results are conducted effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past decades, R has established itself both academically and scientifically. Additionally, many companies now use it for data science (Facebook, Twitter, Google, Airbnb, IBM, etc.), as it allows for more advanced analyses than traditional spreadsheets."

Another way to define RStudio is as a free and open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R.\n",

    "# Installing and Using Libraries in R\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic installation of R, which is installed by default, contains a limited number of libraries that allow us to apply the most commonly used functions. However, in many cases, we may need to perform analyses that are not included in this basic package. Due to the open-source and collaborative nature of R, it is highly likely that another user has already addressed and solved the problem, making their solution available in the form of a library for the entire R user community, completely free of charge. Thanks to R's open and collaborative philosophy, we can directly install and use these libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step, and often the most challenging, is to search online for an available solution in an R library. If found, we may encounter one of the following situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The package is available in the **CRAN** (*Comprehensive R Archive Network*) repository. This is the simplest case, as it can be installed directly from RStudio by running the command `install.packages(\"LibraryName\")`, where the library name is enclosed in quotes. Once installed, the package is loaded using the command `library(\"LibraryName\")` in the R script where it is needed. Library installation is only required the first time, but activating or loading it with the `library()` command must be done each time an R session is started if we wish to use the functions of an installed library that was not included in the basic package.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the package is not available in R's official repository, we need to download it locally from the website that offers it. If the package is compressed, the installation function allows loading it from the local folder where the compressed file is stored. Depending on the operating system, the compressed file will have a different extension (e.g., `.zip` in Windows), though this is usually explicitly defined. In this case, we need to run the following command:  \n",
    "   `install.packages(\"LibraryName.tar.gz\", repos=NULL, type=\"source\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finally, we may want to load a function that we have programmed ourselves or downloaded locally, but which is not a library. In this case, we can use the command `source(\"MyFunction.R\")`. The limitation of this command is that it must be reapplied every time a change is made to the function itself.\n",

    "## Importing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To use data stored in ASCII format (e.g., with `.csv` or `.txt` extensions), which are not native R data files, we need to import these data by specifying certain characteristics about the format in which the data is stored. Among other things, we need to know if the file has headers with the column names, how the columns are separated (spaces, commas, semicolons, etc.), or what character is used to represent the decimal (a point or a comma). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this, RStudio allows us to view the file's content (without loading the data) through the *Open* option in the *File* menu. Another way to view the file's content is to use a text editor, such as Notepad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know the format in which the data is stored, we can use one of the following functions to import the data, paying special attention to the arguments we need to specify for each function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used function to import non-native R files is `read.table()`. This function automatically converts the data into a data frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s now import the data from the file *santander.txt*, which is available on the course website, and assign a name to the data frame. This file contains the monthly average temperature data measured in Santander from 1950 to 2003."

    "The *header* argument should be set to TRUE or FALSE depending on whether the first row of the file contains the variable names. By default, the `read.table()` function assigns FALSE to this argument (meaning there are no headers).

In some cases, it is also possible to do this via certain RStudio menus, but it is more convenient to use the functions directly, as these commands should ideally be saved in our program for future use of the R code."
