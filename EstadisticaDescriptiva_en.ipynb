To achieve this, we will calculate certain statistical measures covered in class, summarize the data in frequency tables, and generate some of the most common types of graphs.

    "A complete frequency table for one variable includes information on absolute frequency, relative frequency, cumulative absolute frequency, and cumulative relative frequency. \n",

    "\n",
    "To begin, we will load the file *pulsations.rda*, available on the course webpage, which we will use in this exercise. This file contains records of 92 individuals across different variables. We can view its content using the command `head(pulsations)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some individuals in this sample were asked to run for a period, while others were not. The first column (*Pulse1*) contains each individual's heart rate at the beginning of the test, while the second column (*Pulse2*) records the heart rate at the end of the test. The third column (*Run*) indicates whether the individual was in the running group or not. The fourth column (*Smoke*) specifies whether the individual smokes or not, and the fifth column (*Sex*) indicates whether the individual is male or female. The sixth (*Height*) and seventh (*Weight*) columns record the individual's height (cm) and weight (kg), respectively. Finally, the eighth column (*Activity*) indicates the type of physical activity the individual usually engages in daily: none, low, medium, or high.\n",
