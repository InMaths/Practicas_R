    "The concept of a random variable allows us to mathematically work with the outcomes of a random experiment and fully characterize the probability of occurrence of any event associated with the experiment. In practice, many situations are characterized by the same random variables (except for some parameters that need to be defined to adjust the distribution function to the specific situation). These common random variables enable us to approach numerous practical situations and solve realistic problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of computers, and R in particular, will allow us to evaluate the probabilities of events associated with common random experiments, including situations for which we have not seen a simple analytical expression in theory. Additionally, it will enable us to simulate random samples from these common experiments and represent probability mass functions (PMF), probability density functions (PDF), or cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of these distributions.\n",

There are distributions for which the cumulative distribution function ($F_X(x)$), despite being easily computable through a summation or an integral, is too laborious to calculate manually or with a basic calculator.\n",
